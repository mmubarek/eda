# Architect in the Loop Agentic Hardware Design and Verification

⚠️ **AI-Generated HDL Disclaimer**

 The example HDL code and cocotb testbench were **generated by an AI system** with limited human supervision.  
 - **Not production-ready**: The code may contain logical errors, inefficiencies, or security flaws.  
 - **Educational / Demonstration only**: The purpose is to showcase the AI agent’s ability to generate HDL and verification tests, not to provide a deployable hardware design.  
 - **No warranty**: Do not use this code in production, safety-critical, or security-sensitive environments without thorough human review and validation.  

 ✅ Treat this as an **example / proof-of-concept**, not a production implementation.


## List of simple cpus generated using our agentic tool with human in the loop
* legv8_multicycle_uart
  - this contains a multicycle legv8 like 32-bit processor. It is tested on DE-10 lite board via uart. Check the README.md in the corresponding directory. Signficant change is made espeically to test with uart.
* LegV8SingleCycleProcessor-synt-cocov2
  - this contains a very simple LegV8 like processor. It is tested with cocotb.
* RISC_Processor-cocotb-passed
  - this contains a very simple 32-bit RISC-V like processor. It passes cocotb test.
* RISCV Processor
  - This also  contains a simple RISC-V processor. Partially synthesized and in early stages of debugging in synthesis.

* LegV8Synth
  -This contains a simple Legv8 like processor, which synthesized for de10 lite with some warnings.
